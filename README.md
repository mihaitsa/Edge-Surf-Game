# Edge Surf Game on Arduino

## Introduction
This is a simplified version of the Edge Surf Game that you can play when your internet is down, but this time it's on an Arduino, and it uses a matrix as the main output device. I believe this to be useful for others, as it can be played when the internet is down.

## Overview

In the game, the player controls the movements using a joystick, and the goal of the game is to make as high of a score as possible while avoiding obstacles, and it's calculated based on the time you lasted.
